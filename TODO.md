## Current Voice Memo recovery — September 29, 2026

- [ ] Merge and deploy the long live memo chunk path, then verify the installed watcher revision and a fresh Doctor receipt.
- [ ] Recover exact failed Voice Memo PK 440 through local-only replay. Verify ledger link, quality, archive and backup without downstream delivery. Recheck watcher and OCI Doctor readiness.

## Active synchronized task: Atlas/MinusPod shared-Whisper cutover

This Penny queue is synchronized with the Atlas execution authority at
`/Volumes/2TB_SSD/GitHub/atlas/.worktrees/minuspod-reliability-fix/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-17-shared-whisper-cutover-handover.md`.
The user authorized the live cutover. The Penny source is locally integrated
on `main` at `f6e531d7919d19e61b7a65d73f5073e39a23e4e3`.

- [x] Shared protocol, authenticated server, one-worker supervisor, worker
  isolation, Penny client, launchd template, and Doctor probe implemented.
- [x] Focused shared-Whisper suite after the timestamp change: `16 passed`,
  Ruff clean, and `python3 -m compileall -q shared_whisper` passed.
- [ ] Penny full suite is not fully green: `602 passed, 2 skipped, 1 failed`.
  The remaining failure is the pre-existing malformed RFC3339 timestamp
  contract test (`TranscriptContractTests.test_checked_maya_schema_uses_full_json_schema_and_format_validation`).
- [x] Merge the validated source into local Penny `main` without pushing.
- [x] Render and back up the `com.penny.shared-whisper` plist with the
  internal token supplied only through the local runtime configuration.
- [x] Capture source/runtime/process/memory evidence, replace the old
  `com.atlas.minuspod-whisper` owner on port 10311, and preserve rollback.
- [x] Verify authenticated MagicDNS health, one worker at most, pinned model
  identity, SSD temp state, and unchanged `com.wyoming.whisper`.
- [x] Disable shared-Whisper word timestamps by default; explicit
  `word_timestamps=true` remains supported. Live idle memory after restart:
  33.3M physical footprint with zero loaded model workers.
- [x] Keep Penny's quality retry path and Atlas's whole-chunk retry path
  separate from process liveness; record durable and downstream receipts in
  the synchronized Atlas cutover receipt.
- [x] Observe one current MinusPod episode through durable finalization: one
  post-cutover processing-history row completed at `2026-09-18T03:52:05Z`,
  with zero post-cutover Whisper-unreachable or generic worker-error rows.
- [x] Run the tracked non-private Penny canary against the local shared owner;
  it returned HTTP 200 with nonempty validated metadata and the pinned model.
- [ ] Continue observing the remaining repaired backlog; the live queue at
  2026-09-18T19:31 PDT was 55 completed, 22 pending, and 1 processing. The
  episode interrupted during restart completed durably with 2 review markers.
- [x] Atlas overlay `91ce1f08` makes shared-Whisper chunk failures fail closed
  instead of returning a partial transcript; Homelab image `2.96.24` is
  built and deployed, with the patched source verified in the container.
- [x] Keep rollback artifacts ready and synchronize this TODO/HANDOFF with
  Atlas after this bounded task. A live Penny-preemption contention receipt
  remains explicitly unexercised because no real Penny capture arrived.
- [ ] Exercise rollback in a disposable or separately approved maintenance
  window; do not disturb the healthy production owner solely to create proof.

The stale Phase A items below are historical generated signals. They do not
override this active shared-Whisper cutover queue.

## OCI GitHub worker path — 2026-09-29

- [x] Retire the queued legacy `oci-ts` AI Review workflow after exact-head
  review. Commit `3068fe0904aebaa0f6348b5e6dc72cd2fdd9fd07` retired the old
  lane; the separate OCI reviewer handled Penny PR #53, and the merged result
  is `37f338e355b9ee05983b3d46f12ec9e9270df6e7`.
- [ ] Establish a replacement receipt for the issue-triage job; no replacement
  receipt is recorded here.
- [ ] Move the scheduled Mac Doctor check off its unmatched public-repository
  `oci-dev` runner label. OCI's SSH alias now reaches the Mac with a verified
  host key, but GitHub run 36457387408 remains queued. A direct OCI-to-Mac
  Doctor run returned `unready` (`launchd_unavailable`, Voice Memos
  `terminal_failure`); restore the Doctor path and prove a natural schedule
  before calling it healthy.
